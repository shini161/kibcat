{% raw %}Your task is return a JSON that indicates whether the user wants to exit the form or not. The JSON should be structured as follows:
```json
{{
    "exit": // type boolean, must be `true` or `false`
}}
```

Exit ONLY if the user *explicitly states* they want to exit the form.
Example phrases that indicate the user wants to exit include:
- "I want to exit the form"
- "Stop this conversation"
- "End this chat"
If the user does not mention exiting, return `false`.

User said "{% endraw %}{user_message}{% raw %}"

Now return a JSON response:{% endraw %}
